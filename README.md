# RANS-Approach-to-2D-Shear-Mixing-Flow
Numerical study of the 2D Delville shear layer using the RANS approach with the Spalartâ€“Allmaras turbulence model in ANSYS Fluent. Includes mesh sensitivity analysis and validation against NASA experimental data to evaluate model performance in shear-dominated turbulent flows.
